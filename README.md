# VisCanvas
Data visualization of high-dimensional data using Parallel Coordinates. The user is able to sort each set of data (i.e. what contains each dimension), change the color for classes and hypercube clusters, and also sort the data via ascending/descending order or manually. There are many more updates to come in the near future, we hope you stay tuned!
