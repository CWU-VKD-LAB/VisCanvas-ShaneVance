# VisCanvas

High-dimensional data visualization tool using General Line Coordinates (GLC). GLC is a parallel coordinate representation of data.

This tool allows users to sort data sets and change the color of its relating classifications. Not to mention, a user has the
ability to change the view to hypercube clusters. They can also sort the data in `asc.` or `desc.` order. Also, there's the option
to do so manually, via click-and-drag.
