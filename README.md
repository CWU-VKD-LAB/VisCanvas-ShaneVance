 # VisCanvas
High-dimensional data visualization tool using General Line Coordinates (GLC). This parallel coordinate representation of data allow for the user to be able to sort each set of data, change the color for the associated classification -- not to mention the ability to change the view of hypercube clusters. The user can also sort the data in ascending or descending order, they also have the otpion to do so manually, via click-and-drag.

This project was a part of my senior capstone project in college. There are several new features and enhancements to come in the near future as the project becomes more sophisticate -- stay tuned in!
