 # VisCanvas
High-dimensional data visualization tool using General Line Coordinates (GLC). This parallel coordinate representation of data allows for the user to sort each set of data, change the color for associated classifications, and not to mention the ability to change the view of hypercube clusters. The user can also sort the data in asc. or desc. order. They also have the option to do so manually, via click-and-drag.

This was a capstone project at Central Washington University that I completed with a team of 3 (inclusive). There are hopes of several new features and enhancements to come in the near future, as this project becomes more mature -- stay tuned!
